          %h2 Living with Commons
          %p 
            Our individual properties lie within a larger area of land which we own in common. Owning commons gives us
            a great degree of control over our watershed and food production systems. Projects which would normally be
            too large for individuals can now be tackled as a community, and we can use our commons to support thriving
            individual businesses within the village.

          %h2 A Democratic Community
          %p
            Atamai Village strives to use a Consensus based decision making process for all it's major decisions. It's
            true that this is more work that simply voting, or electing an emperor of the village, but the payoff
            is that it doesn't leave minority viewpoints or individual villagers feeling bullied by the will of majority.
            Atamai Village Council provides consensus and facilitation training, as well as conflict transformation
            and community building activities.

          %h2 Resilient Neighbours
          %p 
            Living in a village with others who are trying to build a community that is secure in the supply of it's
            basic needs means not having to go it alone as a self-sufficient homesteader. We draw encouragement from
            each other in our efforts to be more resilient, and know that mutual support with other villagers is one
            of our greatest assets in any time of need.

          %h2 Economics & Livelhoods
          %p 
            We aren't a commune, but we do have a policy of attempting to use goods and services from other villagers
            first if possible. Our focus on creating a strong village economy means that we have a range of opportunies
            for new businesses within the village, and sometimes jobs available within existing ones.

          %h2 Long-Term Sustainability
          %p 
            To live in balance with our environment, we have to think long-term. We think that the word "sustainability"
            needs to be taken very literally. The only way that human settlement truly be "sustained" for centuries, or even
            millenia is if we can live within the planets ecological limits.
